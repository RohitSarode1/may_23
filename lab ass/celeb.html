          <strong>Biography: </strong>Shah Rukh Khan, also known by the
          initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in
          Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood"
          and "King Khan", he has appeared in more than 90 films, and earned
          numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded
          the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des
          Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France.
          Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora
          worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described
          as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Many of his
          films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora
          communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and
          grievances.<br />Khan began his career with appearances in several
          television series in the late 1980s, and had his Bollywood debut in
          1992 with Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous
          roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established
          himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films,
          including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997),
          Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie
          Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi
          Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal
          of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a
          hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007) and a man with Asperger syndrome
          in My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the
          romantic dramas Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008),
          and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy
          New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a
          career comeback with the action film Pathaan (2023), which became the
          second-highest-grossing Hindi release.<br />
          As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production
          company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and is the
          co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight
          Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders.
          The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many
          endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. Khan's philanthropic
          endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was
          honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his
          support of children's education and the World Economic Forum's Crystal
          Award in 2018 for advocating for women's and children's rights in
          India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential
          people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their
          fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one
          of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers' poll by Empire,
          and in 2023, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential
          people in the world.<br /><br /><strong>Early life:</strong>Khan was
          born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi. He spent
          the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal
          grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port
          in the 1960s.Khan has described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi
          (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".<br />Khan
          grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi. His father
          had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family
          lived a middle-class life in rented apartments. Khan attended St.
          Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and
          in sports such as hockey and football,and received the school's
          highest award, the Sword of Honour.Initially Khan aspired to pursue a
          career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early
          years meant that he could no longer play.Instead, in his youth, he
          acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of
          Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh
          Bachchan, and Mumtaz.One of his childhood friends and acting partners
          was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.Khan enrolled at
          Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in economics,
          but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG),where
          he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry
          John.After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in mass
          communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting
          career.He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during
          his early career in Bollywood.<br />His father died of cancer in 1981
          and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.After the
          death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born
          1960)fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility
          of caring for her. Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his
          family in their Mumbai mansion.
